# Hypermarket data analysis using Python

### Welcome to my data analysis journey using Python! üêçüéâ 

If you are a data analysis trainer, and want to practice real-world scenarios, I prepared this (and lots of similar ones in the future) to demonstrate how to use Python, Jupyter to extract, analyse and visualize data.

### Overview üí¨

The dataset comprises 45 stores and 81 departments, each displaying varying sales dynamics. While department 72 consistently exhibits higher weekly sales, the overall best-performing department on average is department 92. The disparity in values suggests that certain departments experience seasonal peaks, particularly during Thanksgiving. Notably, the top 5 sales during this holiday all belong to the 72nd department, emphasizing its significant role during Thanksgiving.

Examining store-wide trends, despite occasional spikes in weekly sales for stores 10 and 35, the consistent leaders are store 20 and store 4 in terms of average performance. This indicates that certain regions witness higher seasonal sales. The stores are categorized into three types‚ÄîA, B, and C‚Äîbased on size, with almost half falling into the larger A category. Sales patterns vary according to store type. As expected, holiday average sales surpass those of regular days, with Thanksgiving emerging as the top-selling holiday, as designated by Walmart.

In terms of yearly trends, 2010 records higher sales than 2011 and 2012. Despite the absence of November and December sales data for 2012, the year is not significantly less than 2010. Including the last two months could potentially elevate 2012 to the top spot. Notably, weeks 51 and 47 consistently exhibit high sales values, followed by weeks 50-48. The fifth-highest sales occur in the 22nd week, indicating the significance of Christmas, Thanksgiving, and Black Friday, while the 22nd week in May, coinciding with school closures, also emerges as an important sales period. January sales are notably lower, reflecting the aftermath of elevated November and December sales when consumers prefer to spend less. Lastly, variables such as CPI, temperature, unemployment rate, and fuel price show no discernible pattern in relation to weekly sales.

### Common terms in retail business üìä
- CPI: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures the monthly change in prices paid by U.S. consumers. The CPI is one of the most popular measures of inflation and deflation.
- COGS: Cost of goods sold (COGS) refers to the direct costs of producing the goods sold by a company. This amount includes the cost of the materials and labor directly used to create the good. It excludes indirect expenses, such as distribution costs and sales force costs. Cost of goods sold is also referred to as "cost of sales."
